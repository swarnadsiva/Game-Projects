<p>This repository is a personal portfolio website for Durga Sivamani showcasing past and current game project work. The majority of my experience is in Unity, and thus the code samples here are in C#.</p>
<p>Feel free to browse through the project folders above! They are only scripts, and thus do not a lot of the other work that went into the games (like level design, 3D models, etc.).</p>
