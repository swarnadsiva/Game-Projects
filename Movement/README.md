# Movement

This is a game built to test and explore movement. Not a very creative name, I know, but it's still in process.

## Features

There are several features I want to explore here:
- Moving players using RigidBody components
- Switching between possession of playable characters
- Timed puzzle solving
- AI behavior for players
- AI behavior for obstacles(?) <-- This one is still a work in progress

## Project Goals

I have found that doing a bulk of design work before sitting down to code is extremely helpful. This is why I'll be investigating how to apply software programming patterns to games using [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
